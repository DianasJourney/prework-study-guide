# <Pre-work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This Pre-work Study Guide Webpage was designed for those who are entering boot-camp and want to understand the world of web development.
Building this project we learned how to use Git commands to pull our projects into our Git hub repo, aswell as being able to code for ourselves with the languages HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Creating this project was all about being able to code for the first time for myself, learning that although it can be challenging it was also very rewarding. It also help create a structure for my journey of where I hope to be heading, I have zero knowledge but as I went on creating this project I learned how to use just the gist of the applications and languages.
Going through this project we learn the gist of coding, we learned how to build a structure for our code with HTML, adding in the design with CSS and being able to add functions and debugging anything that wasn't working with Javascript.
